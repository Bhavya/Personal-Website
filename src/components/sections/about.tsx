                        Over the last decade, I've built systems that serve millions of users across fintech, consumer platforms, and developer infrastructure. 
                        At <span className="text-primary font-medium">Chime</span>, I've led teams through high-growth periods, overseeing messaging systems processing 30M+ messages per hour, 
                        building resilience mechanisms that keep banking services running, and creating language frameworks that boost developer productivity.

                    <p>
                        Before fintech, I contributed to products you've probably used. At <span className="text-primary font-medium">Amazon</span>, I worked on 
                        Alexa's style recommendations and real-time routing for Amazon Maps. At <span className="text-primary font-medium">Microsoft</span>, I built 
                        the intelligent storage cleanup features in Windows 10 (earning a patent) and ML-powered content discovery across Windows and Xbox. 
                        My time at <span className="text-primary font-medium">Facebook</span> was spent reimagining photo albums for Timeline and creating the HTML5 batch uploader.

                    <p>
                        As an entrepreneur, I founded <span className="text-primary font-medium">Oat Productivity</span> to create agile planners that blend behavioral science with practical workflows. 
                        I'm also building <span className="text-primary font-medium">Democratized AI Foundry</span> to make advanced AI capabilities accessible to small teams.

                    <p>
                        On the investing side, I'm an active angel investor with a portfolio spanning SaaS, consumer, and infrastructure startups. 
                        I lead the San Francisco chapter of <span className="text-primary font-medium">Brown Girl Angels</span> and advise early-stage companies on technical strategy and team building.
