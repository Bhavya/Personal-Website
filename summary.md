# Bhavya Kashyap – Engineering Leader, Technologist, and Creator

## 🌿 Summary

I’m an engineering leader, technologist, and creator with a track record of building resilient systems, driving inclusive teams, and delivering products that serve millions of users.

Over the last decade, I’ve led and contributed to complex engineering initiatives across fintech, consumer platforms, and developer infrastructure. As an Engineering Manager at Chime, I oversaw foundational services including high-scale messaging systems processing over 30 million messages per hour, critical resilience mechanisms, and language frameworks in Ruby and GoLang, while managing teams of senior engineers through periods of growth and transformation. My experience also spans Amazon Alexa, Amazon Maps, Microsoft Windows, and Facebook’s core engagement products, where I contributed to everything from real-time routing platforms to large-scale content systems.

Outside of my corporate career, I’m the founder of Oat Productivity, creating agile planners that blend behavioral science with practical workflows, and Democratized AI Foundry, focused on making advanced AI capabilities accessible to small teams.

I’m also an active angel investor and community builder. I lead the San Francisco chapter of Brown Girl Angels and invest personally in early-stage companies across infrastructure, AI tooling, and consumer products. My work as a technology advisor and mentor reflects my commitment to supporting founders and helping emerging leaders build high-trust, high-impact teams.

I’ve been recognized as a featured speaker at the Women in Tech Summit and hold a US patent for smart storage policy technology. Beyond technology, I’m passionate about storytelling and interactive design. I’m currently working on a novel exploring dreams and memory and co-developing a cooperative horror game.

Whether scaling distributed systems, coaching senior engineers, or launching new ventures, I bring curiosity, precision, and a bias toward action to every project.
